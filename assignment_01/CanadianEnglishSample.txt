This document is written by a Canadian in Canadian English writing style. Canadian English differs from American English in a few subtle ways. There are few differences in terms of grammar, at least in formal speech. Of course, colloquially, there are differences in the terminology for various words, such as referring to soft drinks as “pop” versus “soda”. While style of speech certainly differs between regions, as well as between countries, it is the spelling of certain words that capture most of the differences between Canadian and American English. In particular, the nations differ in the spelling of words like colour, behaviour, neighbour, favourite and labour. If you were to analyze this document in detail, you might also realize that it contains a number of words that are spelled differently in British English as well.
